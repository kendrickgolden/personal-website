          Hello! Welcome to the website of Kendrick Golden. I gradutated from
          the University of Chicago in the summer of 2023 with a Bachelor's in
          Economics and a Specialization in Data Science, as well as taking
          several computer science courses and working on personal software
          projects.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have professional and personal experience in several different
          programming languages including Java, Python, and C. Over the past
          year, I have focused on improving my web development skills through
          the creation of several projects and hope to leverage my experience
          into a entry level front end development position.
